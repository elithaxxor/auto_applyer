# Proposed Enhancements for JobFlow Pro

The following ideas could expand the capabilities of JobFlow Pro and improve the user experience:

- **Real-Time Job Scraping**: Continuously monitor multiple job boards and notify users when new roles match their criteria.
- **Custom Form Automation**: Extend browser automation to handle proprietary application forms beyond LinkedIn and Indeed.
- **Notification Integration**: Send email or Slack alerts for changes in application status or upcoming interview dates.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Provide insights on resume performance, application outcomes, and time-to-response metrics.
- **Calendar Sync**: Integrate with Google Calendar or Outlook to automatically schedule follow-ups and interviews.
